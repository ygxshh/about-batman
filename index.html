            <p>Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
            The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939).
            Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader,
            the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective.</p>


           <p> Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,
           and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child,
           he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and
           crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City, with assistance from various
           supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin.
           Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess,
           martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will.
           A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker. </p>

    <h2>Secret Identity: Bruce Wayne</h2>
    
    <img src="./img/wayne.png" alt="Bruce Wayne" id="image" />
    
    
    <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist who resides just outside
    of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately
    led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a
    superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment in real estate before the
    city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. Bruce Wayne resides
    just outside of Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation,
    but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women,
    which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time </p>
